# Used Car Price Prediction

This repository contains an analysis of a dataset that contains various attributes of a used car such as Odometer, Model, Condition etc. These attributes are analyzed to determine if the price of a used car can be predicted.

Technologies Used

#### Python Pandas
#### Seaborn
#### MatplotLib
#### Scikit Learn

As a first step the dataset is prepared for analysis by cleaning the data and removing outliers. Once the data cleaning step is complete various predictive models are constructed to predict used car prices.

The model construction step also involves hyperparamater tuning and cross validation. Various models are compared with each other and the most accurate model is chosen. The most accurate model in this case is a Regression model.

After model selection several recommendations are made to used car business owners on the appropriate cars to stock in their inventory so that they can maximize profits.
